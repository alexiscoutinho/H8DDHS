	addonDescription	"Hard Eight now with Death's Door and Headshot!(+) features and Realism (optional).

The internal mode names for use in the console are h8ddhs, rh8ddhs and rh8ddhs+.

These mutations were put together aiming to be as authentic as possible to the original ones. Headshot!+ is an enhancement to the official mutation which enforces that the headshot-only rules apply to all infected. With it, basic bodyshots on specials deal no damage, incendiary ammo only deals fire damage unless it was a headshot, and commons can't kill each other, for example.
